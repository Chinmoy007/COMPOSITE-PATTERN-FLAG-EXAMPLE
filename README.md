# SCENARIO
You need to draw some shapes. Shapes can be basic shapes like line, circle and composite shape like recatngl, trangle [both of them are consists of basic shape line]. So the user has the options to draw line or circle. He also can draw 
composite shape like rectangle. He also have the choice to draw more coplicated shape like flag.

SO the structure will be:

              Flag 
         [Composite Shape]
             /           \
            /             \
         Recatangle       Circle
       /    |    |   \
      /     |    |    \
    line   Line  Line  Line
